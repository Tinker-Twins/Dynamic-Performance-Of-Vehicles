UG for Manuever 2 with Non-Linear Tire Model and Load Transfer is 0.000938 rad sec^2 m^-1

Looking at variation of lateral force vs. slip angle plots for front & rear tires (with load transfer), and assuming
same tire quality (i.e., same breakaway slip angle), we can observe that since the slope of the lateral force vs. slip
angle plot in the linear region (i.e., cornering stiffness) of rear tire is less than that of the front tire, it will
saturate (reach maximum lateral force) before the front tire, indicating that the vehicle will be limit oversteer.
